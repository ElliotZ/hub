# Co-op and Internships
------------

Internship postings, specific company reviews/processes, etc.

Please see Eric's [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/190dl_nHBM-1qDiknOmjwA5-5SJLUUDQn1n10NsS9Bi8/edit?usp=sharing) on behalf of CSS for landing an internship. This covers a bit of everything (resumes, applying, interviews).

### Job Boards

- [intern.supply](http://intern.supply) - Eric highly recommends this. Links are usually broken but this is a master list of fantastic companies that offer internships which you can search for yourself.
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/) - Eric also recommends this - it's not just a social network for bugging recruiters. LinkedIn has an integrated job board where you can find *tons* of internships.
