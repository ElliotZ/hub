#### Deciding the courses
It is always better to have a good plan about the course you'll be taking each semester. Harshdip has completed 4 semesters, taking all the major courses. This way saving up all the electives is one approach. If you find 5 courses overwhelming, taking only 4 courses or an easy elective as a 5th course is another approach. 
Some easy to score electives:
 - 0341 110 Introduction to Economics I
 - 0241 111 Introduction to Economics II
 - COMP 2067 Programming for Beginners

# Co-op and Internships
------------

Internship postings, specific company reviews/processes, etc.

See [Eric's presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/190dl_nHBM-1qDiknOmjwA5-5SJLUUDQn1n10NsS9Bi8/edit?usp=sharing) on behalf of CSS for landing an internship. This covers a bit of everything (resumes, applying, interviews).

### Job Boards

- [intern.supply](http://intern.supply) - Eric highly recommends this. Links are usually broken but this is a master list of fantastic companies that offer internships which you can search for yourself.
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/) - Eric also recommends this - it's not just a social network for bugging recruiters. LinkedIn has an integrated job board where you can find *tons* of internships.
- [Summer 2019 Internships](https://github.com/christine-hu/summer-2019-internships) - A document on Github that keeps track of summer internship opportunities.

### Interview Preparation

Eric recommends studying/practicing technical interview questions for any mid-to-large-sized company. Most of them will ask you highly technical coding questions.

##### Resources
- [LeetCode](http://leetcode.com) - Eric highly recommends LeetCode and used it for all of his interview prep. It has hundreds of questions with difficulty ratings and company-specific questions submitted by interviewees. Most internships will ask LeetCode easy/mediums.
- **Cracking the Coding Interview** - Eric highly recommends reading this book before getting into LeetCode for interview prep. You can find it on Amazon or probably a PDF online.

### Working in the U.S.A.

Almost every major tech company in the USA hires Canadians and will sponsor you for a visa. US companies tend to pay significantly more and provides great opportunities. Eric highly suggests trying to land an internship in the Bay Area or New York.

You'll need to obtain a J-1 intern visa if you're interning in the United States.

A common misconception is that you can simply obtain a visa on your own - this is not true. You need a company who is willing to sponsor your visa to work in the United States. Once you find this company they will do most of the work for you, you'll just have to submit some documents/forms. Don't stress about this step.

#### Getting paid

You'll need an American bank account to get paid if you're working in the USA. This is very easy to obtain - just go to your preferred bank once you're in the USA and bring your passport and visa documents just in case. Eric suggests Bank of America if you're working in the Bay Area - it took him 1 hour to get an account.

It's also a very good idea to obtain a Social Security Number in the USA so that you can apply for a credit card and build up a credit score in the US (can be helpful in many ways in the future). This is also straight-forward and you need to wait until you're in the USA for at least 10 days before you can apply.
