# University of Windsor CSS Events Hub

## Overview

The University of Windsor Computer Science Society Events site was built to provide students with a hub for event listings and registration for Computer Science students. Developing a system in-house allows us to tailor the experience for our specific needs (such as guest limits, guest list, and integration with University of Windsor accounts).

If this sounds like gibberish to you, you'll probably want to learn the basics of `git`. Afterwards, you can follow [this tutorial](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/) on contributing to open-source projects on GitHub.

### Setup

Please follow [this tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-installation.htm) to install `ruby` and the `rails` framework.

After installing rails, you need to install the dependencies (gems). Navigate to the project directory and run:

`$ bundle install`

Bundler will install all of the project dependencies (located in `Gemfile`) of the project. After that you're ready to launch the site using:

`$ rails s`

By default, rails will launch the server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
